        Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid)
        Optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD)
        Regularization techniques
    Single-Layer Model Best Result: [Specify accuracy and any error analysis].
    Multi-Layer Model Best Result: [Specify accuracy and comparison].

3. Analysis of Errors
Single-Layer Model

    Challenges: Struggled with distinguishing [mention specific digits].
    Common Errors: Observed issues with [specific conditions like similar shapes].

Multi-Layer Model

    Improvements: Enhanced differentiation between digits but occasional misclassification between [specific digits].
    Possible Causes of Errors: [E.g., insufficient features, overfitting, data noise, etc.].

4. Observations and Insights

    The multi-layer model generally outperformed the single-layer due to its ability to capture more complex patterns.
    Regularization & Dropout: Helped improve the generalization capability of the multi-layer model.
    The single-layer network was faster and simpler but less accurate, making it better suited for less complex tasks.

Conclusion

The comparison of single-layer and multi-layer architectures for digit recognition demonstrated that while the single-layer model provided faster computations, the multi-layer model achieved superior accuracy and generalization. The trade-offs between performance and computational complexity were evident, highlighting the importance of model selection based on task requirements.
